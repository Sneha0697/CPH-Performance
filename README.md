### Transparency Index : One of the variables influencing performance 

Companies are constantly fighting with one another in order to have a higher market value, earn more profit, raise stock volumes and prices, and so on. One of the most crucial factors affecting all of the previously listed characteristics is the degree of consumer trust obtained by the individual companies. One aspect that influences trust is ethical behavior, which may be quantified using one of the indexes recognized as the transparency index. Although Capri Holdings exceeds Ralph Lauren in numerous areas such as enterprise value, earnings, and stock volume, the company has received relatively low transparency index rankings. This could possibly be one of the causes for Ralph Lauren's high stock price above CPH.</br>
